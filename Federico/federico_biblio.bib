	Abstract = {microRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a class of {\textasciitilde}18--25 nucleotide (nt) single-stranded non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) that are the smallest known carriers of gene-encoded, post-transcriptional regulatory information in both plants and animals. There are many fundamental similarities between plant and animal miRNAs---the miRNAs of both kingdoms play essential roles in development, aging and disease, and the shaping of the transcriptome of many cell types. Both plant and animal miRNAs appear to predominantly exert their genetic and transcriptomic influences by regulating gene expression at the level of messenger RNA (mRNA) stability and/or translational inhibition. Certain miRNA species, such as miRNA-155, miRNA-168, and members of the miRNA-854 family may be expressed in both plants and animals, suggesting a common origin and functional selection of specific miRNAs over vast periods of evolution (for example, Arabidopsis thaliana-Homo sapiens divergence {\textasciitilde}1.5 billion years). Although there is emerging evidence for cross-kingdom miRNA communication---that plant-enriched miRNAs may enter the diet and play physiological and/or pathophysiological roles in human health and disease---some research reports repudiate this possibility. This research paper highlights some recent, controversial, and remarkable findings in plant- and animal-based miRNA signaling research with emphasis on the intriguing possibility that dietary miRNAs and/or sncRNAs may have potential to contribute to both intra- and inter-kingdom signaling, and in doing so modulate molecular-genetic mechanisms associated with human health and disease.},

	Abstract = {MicroRNA-offset RNAs (moRs) were first identified in simple chordates and subsequently in mouse and human cells by deep sequencing of short RNAs. MoRs are derived from sequences located immediately adjacent to microRNAs (miRs) in the primary miR (pri-miR). Currently moRs are considered to be simply a by-product of miR biosynthesis that lack biological activity. Here we show for the first time that a moR is biologically active. We demonstrate that endogenous or over-expressed moR-21 significantly alters gene expression and inhibits the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). In addition, we find that miR-21 and moR-21 may regulate different genes in a given pathway and can oppose each other in regulating certain genes. We report that there is a ``seed region'' of moR-21 as well as a ``seed match region'' in the target gene 3'UTR that are indispensable for moR-21-mediated gene down-regulation. We further demonstrate that moR-21-mediated gene repression is Argonaute 2 (Ago2) dependent. Taken together, these findings provide the first evidence that microRNA offset RNA alters gene expression and is biologically active.},

@article{Yagi2003,
	Abstract = {A survey against the draft genome sequence and the cDNA/EST database of Ciona intestinalis identified a number of genes encoding transcription factors regulating a variety of processes including development. In the present study, we describe almost complete sets of genes for Fox, ETS-domain transcription factors, nuclear receptors, and NF$\kappa$B as well as other factors regulating NF$\kappa$B activity, with their phylogenetic nature. Vertebrate Fox transcription factors are currently delineated into 17 subfamilies: FoxA to FoxQ. The present survey yielded 29 genes of this family in the Ciona genome, 24 of which were Ciona orthologues of known Fox genes. In addition, we found 15 ETS genes, 17 nuclear receptor genes, and several NF$\kappa$B signaling pathway genes in the Ciona genome. The number of Ciona genes in each family is much smaller than that of vertebrates, which represents a simplified feature of the ascidian genome. For example, humans have two NF$\kappa$B genes, three Rel genes, and five NFAT genes, while Ciona has one gene for each family. The Ciona genome also contains smaller numbers of genes for the NF$\kappa$B regulatory system, i.e. after the split of ascidians/vertebrates, vertebrates evolved a more complex NF$\kappa$B system. The present results therefore provide molecular information for the investigation of complex developmental processes, and an insight into chordate evolution.},

	Abstract = {Understanding how the limb blastema is established after the initial wound healing response is an important aspect of regeneration research. Here we performed parallel expression profile time courses of healing lateral wounds versus amputated limbs in axolotl. This comparison between wound healing and regeneration allowed us to identify amputation-specific genes. By clustering the expression profiles of these samples, we could detect three distinguishable phases of gene expression -- early wound healing followed by a transition-phase leading to establishment of the limb development program, which correspond to the three phases of limb regeneration that had been defined by morphological criteria. By focusing on the transition-phase, we identified 93 strictly amputation-associated genes many of which are implicated in oxidative-stress response, chromatin modification, epithelial development or limb development. We further classified the genes based on whether they were or were not significantly expressed in the developing limb bud. The specific localization of 53 selected candidates within the blastema was investigated by in situ hybridization. In summary, we identified a set of genes that are expressed specifically during regeneration and are therefore, likely candidates for the regulation of blastema formation.},

@article{Denoeud1381,
	Abstract = {The Tunicates, which include the solitary free-swimming larvaceans that are a major pelagic component of our oceans, are a basal lineage of the chordates. In order to investigate the major evolutionary transition represented by these organisms, Denoeud et al. (p. 1381, published online 18 November) sequenced the genome of Oikopleura dioica, a chordate placed by phylogeny between vertebrates and amphioxus. Surprisingly, the genome showed little conservation in genome architecture when compared to the genomes of other animals. Furthermore, this highly compacted genome contained intron gains and losses, as well as species-specific gene duplications and losses that may be associated with development. Thus, contrary to popular belief, global similarities of genome architecture from sponges to humans are not essential for the preservation of ancestral morphologies.Genomes of animals as different as sponges and humans show conservation of global architecture. Here we show that multiple genomic features including transposon diversity, developmental gene repertoire, physical gene order, and intron-exon organization are shattered in the tunicate Oikopleura, belonging to the sister group of vertebrates and retaining chordate morphology. Ancestral architecture of animal genomes can be deeply modified and may therefore be largely nonadaptive. This rapidly evolving animal lineage thus offers unique perspectives on the level of genome plasticity. It also illuminates issues as fundamental as the mechanisms of intron gain.},

	Abstract = {Author Summary The nervous system of many animals, including the marine invertebrate Ciona intestinalis in our study, develops through a cell-to-cell communication mechanism called Notch-Delta signaling. Mathematical models for Notch-Delta signaling have been developed that can explain the development of animal nervous systems with a dense arrangement of neurons. However, there are several cases where the spatial arrangement is much more sparse; we found that the peripheral nervous system of Ciona is one such example. Here, we develop an expanded mathematical model that is able to account for this sparser spacing, and furthermore demonstrate that the spacing can be widened or shortened through changing a single parameter that is influenced by the concentration of a regulatory microRNA called miR-124. The underlying differential equations contain only two variables representing the activity levels of Notch and Delta, and are thus general enough to be applicable to a wide variety of physical and biological systems that exhibit a similar sparse patterning.},

@article{Chen4943,
	Abstract = {The nervous system-enriched microRNA miR-124 is necessary for proper nervous system development, although the mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, through a comprehensive analysis of miR-124 and its gene targets, we demonstrate that, in the chordate ascidian Ciona intestinalis, miR-124 plays an extensive role in promoting nervous system development. We discovered that feedback interaction between miR-124 and Notch signaling regulates the epidermal-peripheral nervous system (PNS) fate choice in tail midline cells. Notch signaling silences miR-124 in epidermal midline cells, whereas in PNS midline cells miR-124 silences Notch, Neuralized and all three Ciona Hairy/Enhancer-of-Split genes. Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-124 is sufficient to convert epidermal midline cells into PNS neurons, consistent with a role in modulating Notch signaling. More broadly, genome-wide target extraction with validation using an in vivo tissue-specific sensor assay indicates that miR-124 shapes neuronal progenitor fields by downregulating non-neural genes, notably the muscle specifier Macho-1 and 50 Brachyury-regulated notochord genes, as well as several anti-neural factors including SCP1 and PTBP1. 3'UTR conservation analysis reveals that miR-124 targeting of SCP1 is likely to have arisen as a shared, derived trait in the vertebrate/tunicate ancestor and targeting of PTBP1 is conserved among bilaterians except for ecdysozoans, while extensive Notch pathway targeting appears to be Ciona specific. Altogether, our results provide a comprehensive insight into the specific mechanisms by which miR-124 promotes neuronal development.},

	Abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an extensive class of regulatory RNA whose specific functions in animals are generally unknown. Although computational methods have identified many potential targets of miRNAs, elucidating the spatial expression patterns of miRNAs is necessary to identify the sites of miRNA action. Here, we report the spatial patterns of miRNA transcription during Drosophila embryonic development, as revealed by in situ hybridization to nascent miRNA transcripts. We detect expression of 15 {\textquotedblleft}stand-alone{\textquotedblright} miRNA loci and 9 intronic miRNA loci, which collectively represent 38 miRNA genes. We observe great variety in the spatial patterns of miRNA transcription, including preblastoderm stripes, in aspects of the central and peripheral nervous systems, and in cellular subsets of the mesoderm and endoderm. We also describe an intronic miRNA (miR-7) whose expression pattern is distinct from that of its host mRNA (bancal), which demonstrates that intronic miRNAs can be subject to independent cis-regulatory control. Intriguingly, the expression patterns of several fly miRNAs are analogous to those of their vertebrate counterparts, suggesting that these miRNAs may have ancient roles in animal patterning.},
