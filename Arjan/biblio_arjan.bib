abstract ={trans splicing of a spliced-leader RNA (SL RNA) to the 5′ ends of mRNAs has been shown to have a limited and sporadic distribution among eukaryotes. Within metazoans, only nematodes are known to process polycistronic pre-mRNAs, produced from operon units of transcription, into mature monocistronic mRNAs via an SL RNA trans-splicing mechanism. Here we demonstrate that a chordate with a highly compact genome, Oikopleura dioica, now joins Caenorhabditis elegans in coupling trans splicing with processing of polycistronic transcipts. We identified a single SL RNA which associates with Sm proteins and has a trimethyl guanosine cap structure reminiscent of spliceosomal snRNPs. The same SL RNA, estimated to be trans-spliced to at least 25% of O. dioica mRNAs, is used for the processing of both isolated or first cistrons and downstream cistrons in a polycistronic precursor. Remarkably, intercistronic regions in O. dioica are far more reduced than those in either nematodes or kinetoplastids, implying minimal cis-regulatory elements for coupling of 3′-end formation and trans splicing.},

    abstract = {Abstract In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase (pol) II transcribes the protein-coding genes, whereas RNA pol I transcribes the genes that encode the three RNA species of the ribosome [the ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs)] at the nucleolus. Protozoan parasites of the order Kinetoplastida may represent an exception, because pol I can mediate the expression of exogenously introduced protein-coding genes in these single-cell organisms. A unique molecular mechanism, which leads to pre-mRNA maturation by trans-splicing, facilitates pol I–mediated protein-coding gene expression in trypanosomes. Trans-splicing adds a capped 39-nucleotide mini-exon, or spliced leader transcript, to the 5′ end of the main coding exon posttranscriptionally. In other eukaryotes, the addition of a 5′ cap, which is essential for mRNA function, occurs exclusively as a result of RNA pol II–mediated transcription. Given the assumption that cap addition represents the limiting factor, trans-splicing may have uncoupled the requirement for RNA pol II–mediated mRNA production. A comparison of the α-amanitin sensitivity of transcription in naturally occurring trypanosome protein-coding genes reveals that a unique subset of protein-coding genes—the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) expression sites and the procyclin or the procyclic acidic repetitive protein (PARP) genes—are transcribed by an RNA polymerase that is resistant to the mushroom toxin α-amanitin, a characteristic of transcription by RNA pol I. Promoter analysis and a pharmacological characterization of the RNA polymerase that transcribes these genes have strengthened the proposal that the VSG expression sites and the PARP genes represent naturally occurring protein-coding genes that are transcribed by RNA pol I. }

abstract ={Some pre-mRNAs in nematodes are processed by trans-splicing. In this reaction, a 22-nt 5' terminal exon (the spliced leader, SL) and its associated 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine cap are acquired from a specialized Sm snRNP, the SL RNP. Although it has been evident for many years that not all nematode mRNAs contain the SL sequence, the prevalence of trans-spliced mRNAs has, with the exception of Caenorhabditis elegans, not been determined. To address this question in an organism amenable to biochemical analysis, we have prepared a message-dependent protein synthesis system from developing embryos of the parasitic nematode, Ascaris lumbricoides. Using this system, we have used both hybrid-arrest and hybrid-selection approaches to show that the vast majority (80-90\%) of A. lumbricoides mRNAs contain the SL sequence and therefore are processed by trans-splicing. Furthermore, to examine the effect of SL addition on translation, we have measured levels of protein synthesis in extracts programmed with a variety of synthetic mRNAs. We find that the SL sequence itself and its associated hypermethylated cap functionally collaborate to enhance translational efficiency, presumably at the level of initiation of protein synthesis. These results indicate that trans-splicing plays a larger role in nematode gene expression than previously suspected.},

abstract ={We have used deep sequencing to analyze the pattern of viral microRNA (miRNA) expression observed in the B-cell line BC-3, which is latently infected with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). We recovered 14.6 × 106 total miRNA cDNA reads, of which a remarkable 92\% were of KSHV origin. We detected 11 KSHV miRNAs as well as all 11 predicted miRNA* or passenger strands from the miRNA duplex intermediate. One previously reported KSHV miRNA, miR-K9, was found to be mutationally inactivated. This analysis revealed that the 5′ ends of 10 of the 11 KSHV miRNAs were essentially invariant, with significantly more variation being observed at the 3′ end, a result which is consistent with the proposal that the 5′-proximal region of miRNAs is critical for target mRNA recognition. However, one KSHV miRNA, miR-K10-3p, was detected in two isoforms differing by 1 nucleotide (nt) at the 5′ end that were present at comparable levels, and these two related KSHV miRNAs are therefore likely to target at least partially distinct mRNA populations. Finally, we also report the first detection of miRNA offset RNAs (moRs) in vertebrate somatic cells. moRs, which derive from primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) sequences that immediately flank the mature miRNA and miRNA* strands, were identified flanking one or both sides of nine of the KSHV miRNAs. These data provide new insights into the pattern of miRNA processing in mammalian cells and indicate that this process is highly conserved during animal evolution.},

In the ascidian protochordate Ciona intestinalis, the mRNAs of at least seven genes undergo trans-splicing of a 16-nucleotide 5′-leader apparently derived from a 46-nucleotide RNA that shares features with previously characterized splice donor SL RNAs. SLtrans-splicing was known previously to occur in several protist and metazoan phyla, however, this is the first report of SLtrans-splicing within the deuterostome division of the metazoa. SL trans-splicing is not known to occur in the vertebrates. However, because ascidians are primitive chordates related to vertebrate ancestors, our findings raise the possibility of ancestral SL trans-splicing in the vertebrate lineage.},
