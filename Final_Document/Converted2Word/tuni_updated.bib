@article{Delsuc:2017,
	Abstract = {Background: Tunicates are the closest relatives of vertebrates and are widely used as models to study the evolutionary developmental biology of chordates. Their phylogeny, however, remains poorly understood and to date, only the 18S rRNA nuclear gene and mitogenomes have been used to delineate the major groups of tunicates. To further resolve their evolutionary relationships and provide a first estimate of their divergence times, we used a transcriptomic approach to build a supermatrix consisting of 258 evolutionarily conserved orthologous genes from representative species of all major tunicate lineages. Results: Phylogenetic analyses using site-heterogeneous CAT mixture models of amino acid sequence evolution resulted in a strongly supported tree topology resolving the relationships among four major tunicate clades: 1) Appendicularia, 2) Thaliacea + Phlebobranchia + Aplousobranchia, 3) Molgulidae, and 4) Styelidae + Pyuridae. Notably, the morphologically derived Thaliacea are confirmed as the sister-group of the clade uniting Phlebobranchia + Aplousobranchia within which the precise position of the model ascidian genus Ciona remains uncertain. Relaxed molecular clock analyses accommodating the accelerated evolutionary rate of tunicates reveal ancient diversification (~450-350 million years ago) among the major groups and allow comparing their evolutionary age with respect to the major vertebrate model lineages. Conclusions: Our study represents the most comprehensive phylogenomic dataset so far available for tunicates. It offers a reference phylogenetic framework and first tentative timescale for tunicates, allowing a direct comparison with vertebrate model species in future comparative genomics and evolutionary developmental biology studies.},

@article{Yagi2003,
	Abstract = {A survey against the draft genome sequence and the cDNA/EST database of Ciona intestinalis identified a number of genes encoding transcription factors regulating a variety of processes including development. In the present study, we describe almost complete sets of genes for Fox, ETS-domain transcription factors, nuclear receptors, and NF$\kappa$B as well as other factors regulating NF$\kappa$B activity, with their phylogenetic nature. Vertebrate Fox transcription factors are currently delineated into 17 subfamilies: FoxA to FoxQ. The present survey yielded 29 genes of this family in the Ciona genome, 24 of which were Ciona orthologues of known Fox genes. In addition, we found 15 ETS genes, 17 nuclear receptor genes, and several NF$\kappa$B signaling pathway genes in the Ciona genome. The number of Ciona genes in each family is much smaller than that of vertebrates, which represents a simplified feature of the ascidian genome. For example, humans have two NF$\kappa$B genes, three Rel genes, and five NFAT genes, while Ciona has one gene for each family. The Ciona genome also contains smaller numbers of genes for the NF$\kappa$B regulatory system, i.e. after the split of ascidians/vertebrates, vertebrates evolved a more complex NF$\kappa$B system. The present results therefore provide molecular information for the investigation of complex developmental processes, and an insight into chordate evolution.},

@article{Knapp:2013,
	Abstract = {Understanding how the limb blastema is established after the initial wound healing response is an important aspect of regeneration research. Here we performed parallel expression profile time courses of healing lateral wounds versus amputated limbs in axolotl. This comparison between wound healing and regeneration allowed us to identify amputation-specific genes. By clustering the expression profiles of these samples, we could detect three distinguishable phases of gene expression -- early wound healing followed by a transition-phase leading to establishment of the limb development program, which correspond to the three phases of limb regeneration that had been defined by morphological criteria. By focusing on the transition-phase, we identified 93 strictly amputation-associated genes many of which are implicated in oxidative-stress response, chromatin modification, epithelial development or limb development. We further classified the genes based on whether they were or were not significantly expressed in the developing limb bud. The specific localization of 53 selected candidates within the blastema was investigated by in situ hybridization. In summary, we identified a set of genes that are expressed specifically during regeneration and are therefore, likely candidates for the regulation of blastema formation.},

	Abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an extensive class of regulatory RNA whose specific functions in animals are generally unknown. Although computational methods have identified many potential targets of miRNAs, elucidating the spatial expression patterns of miRNAs is necessary to identify the sites of miRNA action. Here, we report the spatial patterns of miRNA transcription during Drosophila embryonic development, as revealed by in situ hybridization to nascent miRNA transcripts. We detect expression of 15 {\textquotedblleft}stand-alone{\textquotedblright} miRNA loci and 9 intronic miRNA loci, which collectively represent 38 miRNA genes. We observe great variety in the spatial patterns of miRNA transcription, including preblastoderm stripes, in aspects of the central and peripheral nervous systems, and in cellular subsets of the mesoderm and endoderm. We also describe an intronic miRNA (miR-7) whose expression pattern is distinct from that of its host mRNA (bancal), which demonstrates that intronic miRNAs can be subject to independent cis-regulatory control. Intriguingly, the expression patterns of several fly miRNAs are analogous to those of their vertebrate counterparts, suggesting that these miRNAs may have ancient roles in animal patterning.},

	Abstract = {MicroRNA-offset RNAs (moRs) were first identified in simple chordates and subsequently in mouse and human cells by deep sequencing of short RNAs. MoRs are derived from sequences located immediately adjacent to microRNAs (miRs) in the primary miR (pri-miR). Currently moRs are considered to be simply a by-product of miR biosynthesis that lack biological activity. Here we show for the first time that a moR is biologically active. We demonstrate that endogenous or over-expressed moR-21 significantly alters gene expression and inhibits the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). In addition, we find that miR-21 and moR-21 may regulate different genes in a given pathway and can oppose each other in regulating certain genes. We report that there is a ``seed region'' of moR-21 as well as a ``seed match region'' in the target gene 3'UTR that are indispensable for moR-21-mediated gene down-regulation. We further demonstrate that moR-21-mediated gene repression is Argonaute 2 (Ago2) dependent. Taken together, these findings provide the first evidence that microRNA offset RNA alters gene expression and is biologically active.},

@article{Chen4943,
	Abstract = {The nervous system-enriched microRNA miR-124 is necessary for proper nervous system development, although the mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, through a comprehensive analysis of miR-124 and its gene targets, we demonstrate that, in the chordate ascidian Ciona intestinalis, miR-124 plays an extensive role in promoting nervous system development. We discovered that feedback interaction between miR-124 and Notch signaling regulates the epidermal-peripheral nervous system (PNS) fate choice in tail midline cells. Notch signaling silences miR-124 in epidermal midline cells, whereas in PNS midline cells miR-124 silences Notch, Neuralized and all three Ciona Hairy/Enhancer-of-Split genes. Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-124 is sufficient to convert epidermal midline cells into PNS neurons, consistent with a role in modulating Notch signaling. More broadly, genome-wide target extraction with validation using an in vivo tissue-specific sensor assay indicates that miR-124 shapes neuronal progenitor fields by downregulating non-neural genes, notably the muscle specifier Macho-1 and 50 Brachyury-regulated notochord genes, as well as several anti-neural factors including SCP1 and PTBP1. 3'UTR conservation analysis reveals that miR-124 targeting of SCP1 is likely to have arisen as a shared, derived trait in the vertebrate/tunicate ancestor and targeting of PTBP1 is conserved among bilaterians except for ecdysozoans, while extensive Notch pathway targeting appears to be Ciona specific. Altogether, our results provide a comprehensive insight into the specific mechanisms by which miR-124 promotes neuronal development.},

	Abstract = {microRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a class of {\textasciitilde}18--25 nucleotide (nt) single-stranded non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) that are the smallest known carriers of gene-encoded, post-transcriptional regulatory information in both plants and animals. There are many fundamental similarities between plant and animal miRNAs---the miRNAs of both kingdoms play essential roles in development, aging and disease, and the shaping of the transcriptome of many cell types. Both plant and animal miRNAs appear to predominantly exert their genetic and transcriptomic influences by regulating gene expression at the level of messenger RNA (mRNA) stability and/or translational inhibition. Certain miRNA species, such as miRNA-155, miRNA-168, and members of the miRNA-854 family may be expressed in both plants and animals, suggesting a common origin and functional selection of specific miRNAs over vast periods of evolution (for example, Arabidopsis thaliana-Homo sapiens divergence {\textasciitilde}1.5 billion years). Although there is emerging evidence for cross-kingdom miRNA communication---that plant-enriched miRNAs may enter the diet and play physiological and/or pathophysiological roles in human health and disease---some research reports repudiate this possibility. This research paper highlights some recent, controversial, and remarkable findings in plant- and animal-based miRNA signaling research with emphasis on the intriguing possibility that dietary miRNAs and/or sncRNAs may have potential to contribute to both intra- and inter-kingdom signaling, and in doing so modulate molecular-genetic mechanisms associated with human health and disease.},

	Abstract = {The Tunicates, which include the solitary free-swimming larvaceans that are a major pelagic component of our oceans, are a basal lineage of the chordates. In order to investigate the major evolutionary transition represented by these organisms, Denoeud et al. (p. 1381, published online 18 November) sequenced the genome of Oikopleura dioica, a chordate placed by phylogeny between vertebrates and amphioxus. Surprisingly, the genome showed little conservation in genome architecture when compared to the genomes of other animals. Furthermore, this highly compacted genome contained intron gains and losses, as well as species-specific gene duplications and losses that may be associated with development. Thus, contrary to popular belief, global similarities of genome architecture from sponges to humans are not essential for the preservation of ancestral morphologies.Genomes of animals as different as sponges and humans show conservation of global architecture. Here we show that multiple genomic features including transposon diversity, developmental gene repertoire, physical gene order, and intron-exon organization are shattered in the tunicate Oikopleura, belonging to the sister group of vertebrates and retaining chordate morphology. Ancestral architecture of animal genomes can be deeply modified and may therefore be largely nonadaptive. This rapidly evolving animal lineage thus offers unique perspectives on the level of genome plasticity. It also illuminates issues as fundamental as the mechanisms of intron gain.},

	Abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate transcript stability and translation. Functional mature miRNAs are processed from one or both arms of the hairpin precursor. The miR-100/10 family has undergone three independent evolutionary events that have switched the arm from which the functional miRNA is processed. The dominant miR-10 sequences in the insects Drosophila melanogaster and Tribolium castaneum are processed from opposite arms. However, the duplex produced by Dicer cleavage has an identical sequence in fly and beetle. Expression of the Tribolium miR-10 sequence in Drosophila S2 cells recapitulates the native beetle pattern. Thus, arm usage is encoded in the primary miRNA sequence, but outside the mature miRNA duplex. We show that the predicted messenger RNA targets and inferred function of sequences from opposite arms differ significantly. Arm switching is likely to be general, and provides a fundamental mechanism to evolve the function of a miRNA locus and target gene network.},

	Abstract = {Morphological comparisons among extant animals have long been used to infer their long-extinct ancestors for which the fossil record is poor or non-existent. For evolution of the vertebrates, the comparison has typically involved amphioxus and vertebrates. Both groups are evolving relatively slowly, and their genomes share a high level of synteny. Both vertebrates and amphioxus have regulative development in which cell fates become fixed only gradually during embryogenesis. Thus, their development fits a modified hourglass model in which constraints are greatest at the phylotypic stage (i.e., the late neurula/early larva), but are somewhat greater on earlier development than on later development. In contrast, the third group of chordates, the tunicates, which are sister group to vertebrates, are evolving rapidly. Constraints on evolution of tunicate genomes are relaxed, and they have discarded key developmental genes and organized much of their coding sequences into operons, which are transcribed as a single mRNA that undergoes trans-splicing. This contrasts with vertebrates and amphioxus, whose genomes are not organized into operons. Concomitantly, tunicates have switched to determinant development with very early fixation of cell fates. Thus, tunicate development more closely fits a progressive divergence model (shaped more like a wine glass than an hourglass) in which the constraints on the zygote and very early development are greatest. This model can help explain why tunicate body plans are so very diverse. The relaxed constraints on development after early cleavage stages are correlated with relaxed constraints on genome evolution. The question remains: which came first? J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev.

	Abstract = {The formation of the sensory organs and cells that make up the peripheral nervous system (PNS) relies on the activity of transcription factors encoded by proneural genes (PNGs). Although PNGs have been identified in the nervous systems of both vertebrates and invertebrates, the complexity of their interactions has complicated efforts to understand their function in the context of their underlying regulatory networks. To gain insight into the regulatory network of PNG activity in chordates, we investigated the roles played by PNG homologs in regulating PNS development of the invertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis. We discovered that in Ciona, MyT1, Pou4, Atonal, and NeuroD-like are expressed in a sequential regulatory cascade in the developing epidermal sensory neurons (ESNs) of the PNS and act downstream of Notch signaling, which negatively regulates these genes and the number of ESNs along the tail midlines. Transgenic embryos mis-expressing any of these proneural genes in the epidermis produced ectopic midline ESNs. In transgenic embryos mis-expressing Pou4, and MyT1 to a lesser extent, numerous ESNs were produced outside of the embryonic midlines. In addition we found that the microRNA miR-124, which inhibits Notch signaling in ESNs, is activated downstream of all the proneural factors we tested, suggesting that these genes operate collectively in a regulatory network. Interestingly, these factors are encoded by the same genes that have recently been demonstrated to convert fibroblasts into neurons. Our findings suggest the ascidian PNS can serve as an in vivo model to study the underlying regulatory mechanisms that enable the conversion of cells into sensory neurons. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Kusakabe2013,
	Abstract = {Muscle-specific miR-1/206 and miR-133 families have been suggested to play fundamental roles in skeletal and cardiac myogenesis in vertebrates. To gain insights into the relationships between the divergence of these miRs and muscular tissue types, we investigated the expression patterns of miR-1 and miR-133 in two ascidian Ciona species and compared their genomic structures with those of other chordates. We found that Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignyi each possess a single copy of the miR-1/miR-133 cluster, which is only 350 nucleotide long. During embryogenesis, Ciona miR-1 and miR-133 are generated as a single continuous primary transcript accumulated in the nuclei of the tail muscle cells, starting at the gastrula stage. In adults, mature miR-133 and miR-1 are differentially expressed in the heart and body wall muscle. Expression of the reporter gene linked to the 850-bp upstream region of the predicted transcription start site confirmed that this region drives the muscle-specific expression of the primary transcript of miR-1/miR-133. In many deuterostome lineages, including that of Ciona, the miR-1/133 cluster is located in the same intron of the mind bomb (mib) gene in reverse orientation. Our results suggest that the origin of genomic organization and muscle-specific regulation of miR-1/133 can be traced back to the ancestor of chordates. Duplication of this miR cluster might have led to the remarkable elaboration in the morphology and function of skeletal muscles in the vertebrate lineage. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: MicroRNAs (miRNA) are essential 21-22 nt regulatory RNAs produced from larger hairpin-like precursors. Local sequence alignment tools such as BLAST are able to identify new members of known miRNA families, but not all of them. We set out to estimate how many new miRNAs could be recovered using a profile-based strategy such as that implemented in the ERPIN program. RESULTS: We constructed alignments for 18 miRNA families and performed ERPIN searches on animal genomes. Results were compared to those of a WU-BLAST search at the same E-value cutoff. The two combined approaches produced 265 new miRNA candidates that were not found in miRNA databases. About 17{\%} of hits were ERPIN specific. They showed better structural characteristics than BLAST-specific hits and included interesting candidates such as members of the miR-17 cluster in Tetraodon. Profile-based RNA detection will be an important complement of similarity search programs in the completion of miRNA collections.},

	Abstract = {trans splicing of a spliced-leader RNA (SL RNA) to the 5′ ends of mRNAs has been shown to have a limited and sporadic distribution among eukaryotes. Within metazoans, only nematodes are known to process polycistronic pre-mRNAs, produced from operon units of transcription, into mature monocistronic mRNAs via an SL RNA trans-splicing mechanism. Here we demonstrate that a chordate with a highly compact genome, Oikopleura dioica, now joins Caenorhabditis elegans in coupling trans splicing with processing of polycistronic transcipts. We identified a single SL RNA which associates with Sm proteins and has a trimethyl guanosine cap structure reminiscent of spliceosomal snRNPs. The same SL RNA, estimated to be trans-spliced to at least 25% of O. dioica mRNAs, is used for the processing of both isolated or first cistrons and downstream cistrons in a polycistronic precursor. Remarkably, intercistronic regions in O. dioica are far more reduced than those in either nematodes or kinetoplastids, implying minimal cis-regulatory elements for coupling of 3′-end formation and trans splicing.},

	Abstract = {Some pre-mRNAs in nematodes are processed by trans-splicing. In this reaction, a 22-nt 5' terminal exon (the spliced leader, SL) and its associated 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine cap are acquired from a specialized Sm snRNP, the SL RNP. Although it has been evident for many years that not all nematode mRNAs contain the SL sequence, the prevalence of trans-spliced mRNAs has, with the exception of Caenorhabditis elegans, not been determined. To address this question in an organism amenable to biochemical analysis, we have prepared a message-dependent protein synthesis system from developing embryos of the parasitic nematode, Ascaris lumbricoides. Using this system, we have used both hybrid-arrest and hybrid-selection approaches to show that the vast majority (80-90\%) of A. lumbricoides mRNAs contain the SL sequence and therefore are processed by trans-splicing. Furthermore, to examine the effect of SL addition on translation, we have measured levels of protein synthesis in extracts programmed with a variety of synthetic mRNAs. We find that the SL sequence itself and its associated hypermethylated cap functionally collaborate to enhance translational efficiency, presumably at the level of initiation of protein synthesis. These results indicate that trans-splicing plays a larger role in nematode gene expression than previously suspected.},

@article{ShuLee1997,
	Abstract = {Abstract In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase (pol) II transcribes the protein-coding genes, whereas RNA pol I transcribes the genes that encode the three RNA species of the ribosome [the ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs)] at the nucleolus. Protozoan parasites of the order Kinetoplastida may represent an exception, because pol I can mediate the expression of exogenously introduced protein-coding genes in these single-cell organisms. A unique molecular mechanism, which leads to pre-mRNA maturation by trans-splicing, facilitates pol I--mediated protein-coding gene expression in trypanosomes. Trans-splicing adds a capped 39-nucleotide mini-exon, or spliced leader transcript, to the 5′ end of the main coding exon posttranscriptionally. In other eukaryotes, the addition of a 5′ cap, which is essential for mRNA function, occurs exclusively as a result of RNA pol II--mediated transcription. Given the assumption that cap addition represents the limiting factor, trans-splicing may have uncoupled the requirement for RNA pol II--mediated mRNA production. A comparison of the α-amanitin sensitivity of transcription in naturally occurring trypanosome protein-coding genes reveals that a unique subset of protein-coding genes---the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) expression sites and the procyclin or the procyclic acidic repetitive protein (PARP) genes---are transcribed by an RNA polymerase that is resistant to the mushroom toxin α-amanitin, a characteristic of transcription by RNA pol I. Promoter analysis and a pharmacological characterization of the RNA polymerase that transcribes these genes have strengthened the proposal that the VSG expression sites and the PARP genes represent naturally occurring protein-coding genes that are transcribed by RNA pol I. },

	Abstract = {We have used deep sequencing to analyze the pattern of viral microRNA (miRNA) expression observed in the B-cell line BC-3, which is latently infected with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). We recovered 14.6 × 106 total miRNA cDNA reads, of which a remarkable 92\% were of KSHV origin. We detected 11 KSHV miRNAs as well as all 11 predicted miRNA* or passenger strands from the miRNA duplex intermediate. One previously reported KSHV miRNA, miR-K9, was found to be mutationally inactivated. This analysis revealed that the 5′ ends of 10 of the 11 KSHV miRNAs were essentially invariant, with significantly more variation being observed at the 3′ end, a result which is consistent with the proposal that the 5′-proximal region of miRNAs is critical for target mRNA recognition. However, one KSHV miRNA, miR-K10-3p, was detected in two isoforms differing by 1 nucleotide (nt) at the 5′ end that were present at comparable levels, and these two related KSHV miRNAs are therefore likely to target at least partially distinct mRNA populations. Finally, we also report the first detection of miRNA offset RNAs (moRs) in vertebrate somatic cells. moRs, which derive from primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) sequences that immediately flank the mature miRNA and miRNA* strands, were identified flanking one or both sides of nine of the KSHV miRNAs. These data provide new insights into the pattern of miRNA processing in mammalian cells and indicate that this process is highly conserved during animal evolution.},

SLtrans-splicing was known previously to occur in several protist and metazoan phyla, however, this is the first report of SLtrans-splicing within the deuterostome division of the metazoa. SL trans-splicing is not known to occur in the vertebrates. However, because ascidians are primitive chordates related to vertebrate ancestors, our findings raise the possibility of ancestral SL trans-splicing in the vertebrate lineage.},

	Abstract = {Notch-Delta signaling is a fundamental cell-cell communication mechanism that governs the differentiation of many cell types. Most existing mathematical models of Notch-Delta signaling are based on a feedback loop between Notch and Delta leading to lateral inhibition of neighboring cells. These models result in a checkerboard spatial pattern whereby adjacent cells express opposing levels of Notch and Delta, leading to alternate cell fates. However, a growing body of biological evidence suggests that Notch-Delta signaling produces other patterns that are not checkerboard, and therefore a new model is needed. Here, we present an expanded Notch-Delta model that builds upon previous models, adding a local Notch activity gradient, which affects long-range patterning, and the activity of a regulatory microRNA. This model is motivated by our experiments in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis showing that the peripheral sensory neurons, whose specification is in part regulated by the coordinate activity of Notch-Delta signaling and the microRNA miR-124, exhibit a sparse spatial pattern whereby consecutive neurons may be spaced over a dozen cells apart. We perform rigorous stability and bifurcation analyses, and demonstrate that our model is able to accurately explain and reproduce the neuronal pattern in Ciona. Using Monte Carlo simulations of our model along with miR-124 transgene over-expression assays, we demonstrate that the activity of miR-124 can be incorporated into the Notch decay rate parameter of our model. Finally, we motivate the general applicability of our model to Notch-Delta signaling in other animals by providing evidence that microRNAs regulate Notch-Delta signaling in analogous cell types in other organisms, and by discussing evidence in other organisms of sparse spatial patterns in tissues where Notch-Delta signaling is active.},

	Abstract = {A preliminary genome sequence has been assembled for the Southern Ocean salp, Salpa thompsoni (Urochordata, Thaliacea). Despite the ecological importance of this species in Antarctic pelagic food webs and its potential role as an indicator of changing Southern Ocean ecosystems in response to climate change, no genomic resources are available for S. thompsoni or any closely-related urochordate species. Using a multiple-platform, multiple-individual approach, we have produced a 318,767,936 bp genome sequence, covering more than 50{\%} of the estimated 602 MB ($\pm$173 MB) genome size for S. thompsoni Using a non-redundant set of predicted proteins, more than 50{\%} (16,823) of sequences showed significant homology to known proteins and {\~{}}38{\%} (12,151) of the total protein predictions were associated with Gene Ontology functional information. We have generated 109,958 SNP variant and 9,782 indel predictions for this species, serving as a resource for future phylogenomic and population genetic studies. Comparing the salp genome to available assemblies for four other urochordates, Botryllus schlosseri, Ciona intestinalis, Ciona savignyi and Oikopleura dioica, we found that S. thompsoni shares the previously-estimated rapid rates of evolution for these species. High mutation rates are thus independent of genome size, suggesting that rates of evolution {\textgreater}1.5 times that observed for vertebrates are a broad taxonomic characteristic of urochordates. Tests for positive selection implemented in PAML revealed a small number of genes with sites undergoing rapid evolution, including genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and metabolic and immune process that may be reflective of both adaptation to polar, planktonic environments as well as the complex life history of the salps. Finally, we performed an initial survey of small RNAs, revealing the presence of known, conserved miRNAs, as well as novel miRNA genes; unique piRNAs; and mature miRNA signatures for varying developmental stages. Collectively, these resources provide a genomic foundation supporting S. thompsoni as a model species for further examination of the exceptional rates and patterns of genomic evolution shown by urochordates. Additionally, genomic data will allow for the development of molecular indicators of key life history events and processes and afford new understandings and predictions of impacts of climate change on this key species of Antarctic pelagic ecosystems.},

Extending these comparative studies beyond vertebrates is difficult, however, since most ncRNAs evolve quickly at the sequence level while conserving their characteristic secondarystructures.

MicroRNAs are processed from hairpin precursors to {\~{}}22 nucleotide RNAs that base pair to target mRNAs and inhibit expression. As a member of the subphylum Urochordata (Tunicata) whose larval form has a notochord, the sea squirt is situated at the emergence of vertebrates, and therefore may provide information about the evolution of molecular regulators of early development.RESULTS: In this study, computational methods were used to predict 14 microRNA gene families in Ciona intestinalis. The microRNA prediction algorithm utilizes configurable microRNA sequence conservation and stem-loop specificity parameters, grouping by miRNA family, and phylogenetic conservation to the related species, Ciona savignyi. The expression for 8, out of 9 attempted, of the putative microRNAs in the adult tissue of Ciona intestinalis was validated by Northern blot analyses. Additionally, a target prediction algorithm was implemented, which identified a high confidence list of 240 potential target genes. Over half of the predicted targets can be grouped into the gene ontology categories of metabolism, transport, regulation of transcription, and cell signaling.CONCLUSION: The computational techniques implemented in this study can be applied to other organisms and serve to increase the understanding of the origins of non-coding RNAs, embryological and cellular developmental pathways, and the mechanisms for microRNA-controlled gene regulatory networks.},

The lin-4 and let-7 RNA genes are not homologous to each other, but are each complementary to sequences in the 3' untranslated regions of a set of protein-coding target genes that are normally negatively regulated by the RNAs. Here we have detected let-7 RNAs of approximately 21 nucleotides in samples from a wide range of animal species, including vertebrate, ascidian, hemichordate, mollusc, annelid and arthropod, but not in RNAs from several cnidarian and poriferan species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli or Arabidopsis. We did not detect lin-4 RNA in these species. We found that let-7 temporal regulation is also conserved: let-7 RNA expression is first detected at late larval stages in C. elegans and Drosophila, at 48 hours after fertilization in zebrafish, and in adult stages of annelids and molluscs. The let-7 regulatory RNA may control late temporal transitions during development across animal phylogeny.},

@article{Shi2009,
	Abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in various cellular processes. They are thought to function primarily as inhibitors of gene activity by attenuating translation or promoting mRNA degradation. A typical miRNA gene produces a predominant approx21-nucleotide (nt) RNA (the miRNA) along with a less abundant miRNA* product. We sought to identify miRNAs from the simple chordate Ciona intestinalis through comprehensive sequencing of small RNA libraries created from different developmental stages. Unexpectedly, half of the identified miRNA loci encode up to four distinct, stable small RNAs. The additional RNAs, miRNA-offset RNAs (moRs), are generated from sequences immediately adjacent to the predicted approx60-nt pre-miRNA. moRs seem to be produced by RNAse III--like processing, are approx20 nt long and, like miRNAs, are observed at specific developmental stages. We present evidence suggesting that the biogenesis of moRs results from an intrinsic property of the miRNA processing machinery in C. intestinalis.},

@misc{Swalla1995,
	Abstract = {A cDNA library prepared from one-cell zygotes of the ascidian Styela clava was screened with probes from isolated cellular fractions to identify clones encoding RNAs localized in the yellow crescent or myoplasm, a cytoskeletal domain with multiple developmental roles. The differential screen yielded five overlapping cDNA (Styela clava yellow crescent or ScYC) clones encoding a 1.2-kb polyadenylated RNA (yellow crescent or YC RNA) which is present throughout embryonic development. In situ hybridization confirmed that YC RNA is localized in the yellow crescent. Antisense probes containing the 3' region of YC RNA hybridize with multiple maternal and zygotic RNAs, suggesting sequence homologies with other transcripts. YC RNA was first detected during oogenesis when transcripts accumulate in the perinuclear region of vitellogenic oocytes and are gradually translocated to the cortex. The YC transcripts are localized in the cortex of unfertilized eggs but after fertilization segregate with the myoplasm to the yellow crescent. During cleavage most YC transcripts enter the primary muscle cell lineage. YC RNA is also present in the secondary muscle cells. The YC transcripts are retained in the myoplasm of oocytes and eggs extracted with the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100, suggesting that they are associated with the cytoskeleton. The nucleotide sequence of the longest ScYC clone contains a short open reading frame (ORF). The YC ORF would encode a putative polypeptide of 49 amino acids, which shows no significant homology to known proteins. Several features of the YC RNA, however, suggest that it functions as an RNA rather than as a protein coding molecule. We conclude that the myoplasm contains a novel maternal RNA which is associated with the cytoskeleton and segregated to the muscle cells during ascidian embryogenesis. The YC RNA may be a new member of a growing family of noncoding RNAs that play important roles in growth and development.},

@article{Terai2012,
	Abstract = {MicroRNA (miRNA) precursor hairpins have a unique secondary structure, nucleotide length, and nucleotide content that are in most cases evolutionarily conserved. The aim of this study was to utilize position-specific features of miRNA hairpins to improve their identification. To this end, we defined the evolutionary and structurally conserved features in each position of miRNA hairpins with heuristically derived values, which were successfully integrated using a probabilistic framework. Our method, miRRim2, can not only accurately detect miRNA hairpins, but infer the location of a mature miRNA sequence. To evaluate the accuracy of miRRim2, we designed a cross validation test in which the whole human genome was used for evaluation. miRRim2 could more accurately detect miRNA hairpins than the other computational predictions that had been performed on the human genome, and detect the position of the 5'-end of mature miRNAs with sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) above 0.4. To further evaluate miRRim2 on independent data, we applied it to the Ciona intestinalis genome. Our method detected 47 known miRNA hairpins among top 115 candidates, and pinpointed the 5'-end of mature miRNAs with sensitivity and PPV about 0.4. When our results were compared with deep-sequencing reads of small RNA libraries from Ciona intestinalis cells, we found several candidates in which the predicted mature miRNAs were in good accordance with deep-sequencing results.},

@article{Will2007,
	Abstract = {The RFAM database defines families of ncRNAs by means of sequence similarities that are sufficient to establish homology. In some cases, such as microRNAs and box H/ACA snoRNAs, functional commonalities define classes of RNAs that are characterized by structural similarities, and typically consist of multiple RNA families. Recent advances in high-throughput transcriptomics and comparative genomics have produced very large sets of putative noncoding RNAs and regulatory RNA signals. For many of them, evidence for stabilizing selection acting on their secondary structures has been derived, and at least approximate models of their structures have been computed. The overwhelming majority of these hypothetical RNAs cannot be assigned to established families or classes. We present here a structure-based clustering approach that is capable of extracting putative RNA classes from genome-wide surveys for structured RNAs. The LocARNA (local alignment of RNA) tool implements a novel variant of the Sankoff algorithm that is sufficiently fast to deal with several thousand candidate sequences. The method is also robust against false positive predictions, i.e., a contamination of the input data with unstructured or nonconserved sequences. We have successfully tested the LocARNA-based clustering approach on the sequences of the RFAM-seed alignments. Furthermore, we have applied it to a previously published set of 3,332 predicted structured elements in the Ciona intestinalis genome (Missal K, Rose D, Stadler PF (2005) Noncoding RNAs in Ciona intestinalis. Bioinformatics 21 (Supplement 2): i77-i78). In addition to recovering, e.g., tRNAs as a structure-based class, the method identifies several RNA families, including microRNA and snoRNA candidates, and suggests several novel classes of ncRNAs for which to date no representative has been experimentally characterized.},

with the expression results, we found that inhibition of TGFβ signaling blocked OS regeneration.
 A correlation network was subsequently inferred for all predicted microRNA-mRNA target pairs ex
