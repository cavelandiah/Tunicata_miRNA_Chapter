abstract = {Morphological comparisons among extant animals have long been used to infer their long-extinct ancestors for which the fossil record is poor or non-existent. For evolution of the vertebrates, the comparison has typically involved amphioxus and vertebrates. Both groups are evolving relatively slowly, and their genomes share a high level of synteny. Both vertebrates and amphioxus have regulative development in which cell fates become fixed only gradually during embryogenesis. Thus, their development fits a modified hourglass model in which constraints are greatest at the phylotypic stage (i.e., the late neurula/early larva), but are somewhat greater on earlier development than on later development. In contrast, the third group of chordates, the tunicates, which are sister group to vertebrates, are evolving rapidly. Constraints on evolution of tunicate genomes are relaxed, and they have discarded key developmental genes and organized much of their coding sequences into operons, which are transcribed as a single mRNA that undergoes trans-splicing. This contrasts with vertebrates and amphioxus, whose genomes are not organized into operons. Concomitantly, tunicates have switched to determinant development with very early fixation of cell fates. Thus, tunicate development more closely fits a progressive divergence model (shaped more like a wine glass than an hourglass) in which the constraints on the zygote and very early development are greatest. This model can help explain why tunicate body plans are so very diverse. The relaxed constraints on development after early cleavage stages are correlated with relaxed constraints on genome evolution. The question remains: which came first? J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev.

abstract = {The formation of the sensory organs and cells that make up the peripheral nervous system (PNS) relies on the activity of transcription factors encoded by proneural genes (PNGs). Although PNGs have been identified in the nervous systems of both vertebrates and invertebrates, the complexity of their interactions has complicated efforts to understand their function in the context of their underlying regulatory networks. To gain insight into the regulatory network of PNG activity in chordates, we investigated the roles played by PNG homologs in regulating PNS development of the invertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis. We discovered that in Ciona, MyT1, Pou4, Atonal, and NeuroD-like are expressed in a sequential regulatory cascade in the developing epidermal sensory neurons (ESNs) of the PNS and act downstream of Notch signaling, which negatively regulates these genes and the number of ESNs along the tail midlines. Transgenic embryos mis-expressing any of these proneural genes in the epidermis produced ectopic midline ESNs. In transgenic embryos mis-expressing Pou4, and MyT1 to a lesser extent, numerous ESNs were produced outside of the embryonic midlines. In addition we found that the microRNA miR-124, which inhibits Notch signaling in ESNs, is activated downstream of all the proneural factors we tested, suggesting that these genes operate collectively in a regulatory network. Interestingly, these factors are encoded by the same genes that have recently been demonstrated to convert fibroblasts into neurons. Our findings suggest the ascidian PNS can serve as an in vivo model to study the underlying regulatory mechanisms that enable the conversion of cells into sensory neurons. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

We have identified a group of lncRNAs, including rhabdomyosarcoma 2-associated transcript (RMST), which are indispensable for neurogenesis. Here, we provide mechanistic insight into the role of human RMST in modulating neurogenesis. RMST expression is specific to the brain, regulated by the transcriptional repressor REST, and increases during neuronal differentiation, indicating a role in neurogenesis. RMST physically interacts with SOX2, a transcription factor known to regulate neural fate. RMST and SOX2 coregulate a large pool of downstream genes implicated in neurogenesis. Through RNA interference and genome-wide SOX2 binding studies, we found that RMST is required for the binding of SOX2 to promoter regions of neurogenic transcription factors. These results establish the role of RMST as a transcriptional coregulator of SOX2 and a key player in the regulation of neural stem cell fate. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The human brain is one of the most complex biological systems, and the cognitive abilities have greatly expanded compared to invertebrates without much expansion in the number of protein coding genes. This suggests that gene regulation plays a very important role in the development and function of nervous system, by acting at multiple levels such as transcription and translation. In this article we discuss the regulatory roles of three classes of non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs)-microRNAs (miRNAs), piwi-interacting RNA (piRNAs) and long-non-coding RNA (lncRNA), in the process of neurogenesis and nervous function including control of synaptic plasticity and potential roles in neurodegenerative diseases. miRNAs are involved in diverse processes including neurogenesis where they channelize the cellular physiology toward neuronal differentiation. miRNAs can also indirectly influence neurogenesis by regulating the proliferation and self renewal of neural stem cells and are dysregulated in several neurodegenerative diseases. miRNAs are also known to regulate synaptic plasticity and are usually found to be co-expressed with their targets. The dynamics of gene regulation is thus dependent on the local architecture of the gene regulatory network (GRN) around the miRNA and its targets. piRNAs had been classically known to regulate transposons in the germ cells. However, piRNAs have been, recently, found to be expressed in the brain and possibly function by imparting epigenetic changes by DNA methylation. piRNAs are known to be maternally inherited and we assume that they may play a role in early development. We also explore the possible function of piRNAs in regulating the expansion of transposons in the brain. Brain is known to express several lncRNA but functional roles in brain development are attributed to a few lncRNA while functions of most of the them remain unknown. We review the roles of some known lncRNA and explore the other possible functions of lncRNAs including their interaction with miRNAs.},

abstract = {Notch-Delta signaling is a fundamental cell-cell communication mechanism that governs the differentiation of many cell types. Most existing mathematical models of Notch-Delta signaling are based on a feedback loop between Notch and Delta leading to lateral inhibition of neighboring cells. These models result in a checkerboard spatial pattern whereby adjacent cells express opposing levels of Notch and Delta, leading to alternate cell fates. However, a growing body of biological evidence suggests that Notch-Delta signaling produces other patterns that are not checkerboard, and therefore a new model is needed. Here, we present an expanded Notch-Delta model that builds upon previous models, adding a local Notch activity gradient, which affects long-range patterning, and the activity of a regulatory microRNA. This model is motivated by our experiments in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis showing that the peripheral sensory neurons, whose specification is in part regulated by the coordinate activity of Notch-Delta signaling and the microRNA miR-124, exhibit a sparse spatial pattern whereby consecutive neurons may be spaced over a dozen cells apart. We perform rigorous stability and bifurcation analyses, and demonstrate that our model is able to accurately explain and reproduce the neuronal pattern in Ciona. Using Monte Carlo simulations of our model along with miR-124 transgene over-expression assays, we demonstrate that the activity of miR-124 can be incorporated into the Notch decay rate parameter of our model. Finally, we motivate the general applicability of our model to Notch-Delta signaling in other animals by providing evidence that microRNAs regulate Notch-Delta signaling in analogous cell types in other organisms, and by discussing evidence in other organisms of sparse spatial patterns in tissues where Notch-Delta signaling is active.},

abstract = {Cephalochordates, urochordates, and vertebrates comprise the three extant groups of chordates. Although higher morphological and developmental similarity exists between cephalochordates and vertebrates, molecular phylogeny studies have instead suggested that the morphologically simplified urochordates are the closest relatives to vertebrates. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regarded as the major factors driving the increase of morphological complexity in early vertebrate evolution, and are extensively characterized in vertebrates and in a few species of urochordates. However, the comprehensive set of miRNAs in the basal chordates, namely the cephalochordates, remains undetermined. Through extensive sequencing of a small RNA library and genomic homology searches, we characterized 100 miRNAs from the cephalochordate amphioxus, Branchiostoma japonicum, and B. floridae. Analysis of the evolutionary history of the cephalochordate miRNAs showed that cephalochordates possess 54 miRNA families homologous to those of vertebrates, which is threefold higher than those shared between urochordates and vertebrates. The miRNA contents demonstrated a clear correlation between the extent of miRNA overlapping and morphological similarity among the three chordate groups, providing a strong evidence of miRNAs being the major genetic factors driving morphological complexity in early chordate evolution.},

abstract = {Recent studies reveal correlation between microRNA (miRNA) innovation and increased developmental complexity. This is exemplified by dramatic expansion of the miRNA inventory in vertebrates, a lineage where genome duplication has played a significant evolutionary role. Urochordates, the closest extant group to the vertebrates, exhibit an opposite trend to genome and morphological simplification. We show that the urochordate, larvacean, Oikopleura dioica, possesses the requisite miRNA biogenic machinery. The miRNAs isolated by small RNA cloning were expressed throughout the short life cycle, a number of which were stocked as maternal determinants prior to rapid embryonic development. We identify sex-specific miRNAs that appeared as male/female gonad differentiation became apparent and were maintained throughout spermatogenesis. Whereas 80{\%} of mammalian miRNAs are hosted in introns of protein-coding genes, the majority of O. dioica miRNA loci were located in antisense orientations to such genes. Including sister group ascidians in analysis of the urochordate miRNA repertoire, we find that 11 highly conserved bilaterian miRNA families have been lost or derived to the point they are not recognizable in urochordates and a further 4 of these families are absent in larvaceans. Subsequent to this loss/derivation, at least 29 novel miRNA families have been acquired in larvaceans. This suggests a profound reorganization of the miRNA repertoire integral to evolution in the urochordate lineage.},

We confirm previous observations regarding bursts of innovations accompanying the three rounds of genome duplications in vertebrate evolution and in the early evolution of placental mammals. With a much better resolution for the invertebrate lineage compared to large-scale studies, we observe additional bursts of innovation, e.g., in Rhabditoidea. More importantly, we see clear evidence that loss of microRNA families is not an uncommon phenomenon. The Enoplea may serve as a second dramatic example beyond the tunicates.

Despite the ecological importance of this species in Antarctic pelagic food webs and its potential role as an indicator of changing Southern Ocean ecosystems in response to climate change, no genomic resources are available for S. thompsoni or any closely-related urochordate species. Using a multiple-platform, multiple-individual approach, we have produced a 318,767,936 bp genome sequence, covering more than 50{\%} of the estimated 602 MB (±173 MB) genome size for S. thompsoni Using a non-redundant set of predicted proteins, more than 50{\%} (16,823) of sequences showed significant homology to known proteins and {\~{}}38{\%} (12,151) of the total protein predictions were associated with Gene Ontology functional information. We have generated 109,958 SNP variant and 9,782 indel predictions for this species, serving as a resource for future phylogenomic and population genetic studies. Comparing the salp genome to available assemblies for four other urochordates, Botryllus schlosseri, Ciona intestinalis, Ciona savignyi and Oikopleura dioica, we found that S. thompsoni shares the previously-estimated rapid rates of evolution for these species. High mutation rates are thus independent of genome size, suggesting that rates of evolution {\textgreater}1.5 times that observed for vertebrates are a broad taxonomic characteristic of urochordates. Tests for positive selection implemented in PAML revealed a small number of genes with sites undergoing rapid evolution, including genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and metabolic and immune process that may be reflective of both adaptation to polar, planktonic environments as well as the complex life history of the salps. Finally, we performed an initial survey of small RNAs, revealing the presence of known, conserved miRNAs, as well as novel miRNA genes; unique piRNAs; and mature miRNA signatures for varying developmental stages. Collectively, these resources provide a genomic foundation supporting S. thompsoni as a model species for further examination of the exceptional rates and patterns of genomic evolution shown by urochordates. Additionally, genomic data will allow for the development of molecular indicators of key life history events and processes and afford new understandings and predictions of impacts of climate change on this key species of Antarctic pelagic ecosystems.},

abstract = {Muscle-specific miR-1/206 and miR-133 families have been suggested to play fundamental roles in skeletal and cardiac myogenesis in vertebrates. To gain insights into the relationships between the divergence of these miRs and muscular tissue types, we investigated the expression patterns of miR-1 and miR-133 in two ascidian Ciona species and compared their genomic structures with those of other chordates. We found that Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignyi each possess a single copy of the miR-1/miR-133 cluster, which is only 350 nucleotide long. During embryogenesis, Ciona miR-1 and miR-133 are generated as a single continuous primary transcript accumulated in the nuclei of the tail muscle cells, starting at the gastrula stage. In adults, mature miR-133 and miR-1 are differentially expressed in the heart and body wall muscle. Expression of the reporter gene linked to the 850-bp upstream region of the predicted transcription start site confirmed that this region drives the muscle-specific expression of the primary transcript of miR-1/miR-133. In many deuterostome lineages, including that of Ciona, the miR-1/133 cluster is located in the same intron of the mind bomb (mib) gene in reverse orientation. Our results suggest that the origin of genomic organization and muscle-specific regulation of miR-1/133 can be traced back to the ancestor of chordates. Duplication of this miR cluster might have led to the remarkable elaboration in the morphology and function of skeletal muscles in the vertebrate lineage. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Local sequence alignment tools such as BLAST are able to identify new members of known miRNA families, but not all of them. We set out to estimate how many new miRNAs could be recovered using a profile-based strategy such as that implemented in the ERPIN program. RESULTS: We constructed alignments for 18 miRNA families and performed ERPIN searches on animal genomes. Results were compared to those of a WU-BLAST search at the same E-value cutoff. The two combined approaches produced 265 new miRNA candidates that were not found in miRNA databases. About 17{\%} of hits were ERPIN specific. They showed better structural characteristics than BLAST-specific hits and included interesting candidates such as members of the miR-17 cluster in Tetraodon. Profile-based RNA detection will be an important complement of similarity search programs in the completion of miRNA collections.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study reports the first collection of validated microRNA genes in the sea squirt, Ciona intestinalis. MicroRNAs are processed from hairpin precursors to {\~{}}22 nucleotide RNAs that base pair to target mRNAs and inhibit expression. As a member of the subphylum Urochordata (Tunicata) whose larval form has a notochord, the sea squirt is situated at the emergence of vertebrates, and therefore may provide information about the evolution of molecular regulators of early development.RESULTS: In this study, computational methods were used to predict 14 microRNA gene families in Ciona intestinalis. The microRNA prediction algorithm utilizes configurable microRNA sequence conservation and stem-loop specificity parameters, grouping by miRNA family, and phylogenetic conservation to the related species, Ciona savignyi. The expression for 8, out of 9 attempted, of the putative microRNAs in the adult tissue of Ciona intestinalis was validated by Northern blot analyses. Additionally, a target prediction algorithm was implemented, which identified a high confidence list of 240 potential target genes. Over half of the predicted targets can be grouped into the gene ontology categories of metabolism, transport, regulation of transcription, and cell signaling.CONCLUSION: The computational techniques implemented in this study can be applied to other organisms and serve to increase the understanding of the origins of non-coding RNAs, embryological and cellular developmental pathways, and the mechanisms for microRNA-controlled gene regulatory networks.},

Transition from the first to the second larval stage fates requires the 22-nucleotide lin-4 RNA, and transition from late larval to adult cell fates requires the 21-nucleotide let-7 RNA. The lin-4 and let-7 RNA genes are not homologous to each other, but are each complementary to sequences in the 3' untranslated regions of a set of protein-coding target genes that are normally negatively regulated by the RNAs. Here we have detected let-7 RNAs of approximately 21 nucleotides in samples from a wide range of animal species, including vertebrate, ascidian, hemichordate, mollusc, annelid and arthropod, but not in RNAs from several cnidarian and poriferan species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli or Arabidopsis. We did not detect lin-4 RNA in these species. We found that let-7 temporal regulation is also conserved: let-7 RNA expression is first detected at late larval stages in C. elegans and Drosophila, at 48 hours after fertilization in zebrafish, and in adult stages of annelids and molluscs. The let-7 regulatory RNA may control late temporal transitions during development across animal phylogeny.},

abstract = {Annotation of orthologous and paralogous genes is necessary for many aspects of evolutionary analysis. Methods to infer these homology relationships have traditionally focused on protein-coding genes and evolutionary models used by these methods normally assume the positions in the protein evolve independently. However, as our appreciation for the roles of non-coding RNA genes has increased, consistently annotated sets of orthologous and paralogous ncRNA genes are increasingly needed. At the same time, methods such as PHASE or RAxML have implemented substitution models that consider pairs of sites to enable proper modelling of the loops and other features of RNA secondary structure. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis pipeline for the automatic detection of orthologues and paralogues for ncRNA genes. We focus on gene families represented in Rfam and for which a specific covariance model is provided. For each family ncRNA genes found in all Ensembl species are aligned using Infernal, and several trees are built using different substitution models. In parallel, a genomic alignment that includes the ncRNA genes and their flanking sequence regions is built with PRANK. This alignment is used to create two additional phylogenetic trees using the neighbour-joining (NJ) and maximum-likelihood (ML) methods. The trees arising from both the ncRNA and genomic alignments are merged using TreeBeST, which reconciles them with the species tree in order to identify speciation and duplication events. The final tree is used to infer the orthologues and paralogues following Fitch's definition. We also determine gene gain and loss events for each family using CAFE. All data are accessible through the Ensembl Comparative Genomics ('Compara') API, on our FTP site and are fully integrated in the Ensembl genome browser, where they can be accessed in a user-friendly manner.Database URL: http://www.ensembl.org.},

The miR-100/10 family has undergone three independent evolutionary events that have switched the arm from which the functional miRNA is processed. The dominant miR-10 sequences in the insects Drosophila melanogaster and Tribolium castaneum are processed from opposite arms. However, the duplex produced by Dicer cleavage has an identical sequence in fly and beetle. Expression of the Tribolium miR-10 sequence in Drosophila S2 cells recapitulates the native beetle pattern. Thus, arm usage is encoded in the primary miRNA sequence, but outside the mature miRNA duplex. We show that the predicted messenger RNA targets and inferred function of sequences from opposite arms differ significantly. Arm switching is likely to be general, and provides a fundamental mechanism to evolve the function of a miRNA locus and target gene network.},

We sought to identify miRNAs from the simple chordate Ciona intestinalis through comprehensive sequencing of small RNA libraries created from different developmental stages. Unexpectedly, half of the identified miRNA loci encode up to four distinct, stable small RNAs. The additional RNAs, miRNA-offset RNAs (moRs), are generated from sequences immediately adjacent to the predicted approx60-nt pre-miRNA. moRs seem to be produced by RNAse III–like processing, are approx20 nt long and, like miRNAs, are observed at specific developmental stages. We present evidence suggesting that the biogenesis of moRs results from an intrinsic property of the miRNA processing machinery in C. intestinalis.},

Extending these comparative studies beyond vertebrates is difficult, however, since most ncRNAs evolve quickly at the sequence level while conserving their characteristic secondarystructures.

abstract = {The RFAM database defines families of ncRNAs by means of sequence similarities that are sufficient to establish homology. In some cases, such as microRNAs and box H/ACA snoRNAs, functional commonalities define classes of RNAs that are characterized by structural similarities, and typically consist of multiple RNA families. Recent advances in high-throughput transcriptomics and comparative genomics have produced very large sets of putative noncoding RNAs and regulatory RNA signals. For many of them, evidence for stabilizing selection acting on their secondary structures has been derived, and at least approximate models of their structures have been computed. The overwhelming majority of these hypothetical RNAs cannot be assigned to established families or classes. We present here a structure-based clustering approach that is capable of extracting putative RNA classes from genome-wide surveys for structured RNAs. The LocARNA (local alignment of RNA) tool implements a novel variant of the Sankoff algorithm that is sufficiently fast to deal with several thousand candidate sequences. The method is also robust against false positive predictions, i.e., a contamination of the input data with unstructured or nonconserved sequences. We have successfully tested the LocARNA-based clustering approach on the sequences of the RFAM-seed alignments. Furthermore, we have applied it to a previously published set of 3,332 predicted structured elements in the Ciona intestinalis genome (Missal K, Rose D, Stadler PF (2005) Noncoding RNAs in Ciona intestinalis. Bioinformatics 21 (Supplement 2): i77-i78). In addition to recovering, e.g., tRNAs as a structure-based class, the method identifies several RNA families, including microRNA and snoRNA candidates, and suggests several novel classes of ncRNAs for which to date no representative has been experimentally characterized.},

abstract = {A cDNA library prepared from one-cell zygotes of the ascidian Styela clava was screened with probes from isolated cellular fractions to identify clones encoding RNAs localized in the yellow crescent or myoplasm, a cytoskeletal domain with multiple developmental roles. The differential screen yielded five overlapping cDNA (Styela clava yellow crescent or ScYC) clones encoding a 1.2-kb polyadenylated RNA (yellow crescent or YC RNA) which is present throughout embryonic development. In situ hybridization confirmed that YC RNA is localized in the yellow crescent. Antisense probes containing the 3' region of YC RNA hybridize with multiple maternal and zygotic RNAs, suggesting sequence homologies with other transcripts. YC RNA was first detected during oogenesis when transcripts accumulate in the perinuclear region of vitellogenic oocytes and are gradually translocated to the cortex. The YC transcripts are localized in the cortex of unfertilized eggs but after fertilization segregate with the myoplasm to the yellow crescent. During cleavage most YC transcripts enter the primary muscle cell lineage. YC RNA is also present in the secondary muscle cells. The YC transcripts are retained in the myoplasm of oocytes and eggs extracted with the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100, suggesting that they are associated with the cytoskeleton. The nucleotide sequence of the longest ScYC clone contains a short open reading frame (ORF). The YC ORF would encode a putative polypeptide of 49 amino acids, which shows no significant homology to known proteins. Several features of the YC RNA, however, suggest that it functions as an RNA rather than as a protein coding molecule. We conclude that the myoplasm contains a novel maternal RNA which is associated with the cytoskeleton and segregated to the muscle cells during ascidian embryogenesis. The YC RNA may be a new member of a growing family of noncoding RNAs that play important roles in growth and development.},

The aim of this study was to utilize position-specific features of miRNA hairpins to improve their identification. To this end, we defined the evolutionary and structurally conserved features in each position of miRNA hairpins with heuristically derived values, which were successfully integrated using a probabilistic framework. Our method, miRRim2, can not only accurately detect miRNA hairpins, but infer the location of a mature miRNA sequence. To evaluate the accuracy of miRRim2, we designed a cross validation test in which the whole human genome was used for evaluation. miRRim2 could more accurately detect miRNA hairpins than the other computational predictions that had been performed on the human genome, and detect the position of the 5'-end of mature miRNAs with sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) above 0.4. To further evaluate miRRim2 on independent data, we applied it to the Ciona intestinalis genome. Our method detected 47 known miRNA hairpins among top 115 candidates, and pinpointed the 5'-end of mature miRNAs with sensitivity and PPV about 0.4. When our results were compared with deep-sequencing reads of small RNA libraries from Ciona intestinalis cells, we found several candidates in which the predicted mature miRNAs were in good accordance with deep-sequencing results.},

abstract = {Mir-181 is an ancient microRNA (miRNA) gene family that originated in urochordata. Although their functions were subjected to extensive studies in recent years, their evolutionary process remains largely unknown. Here we systematically investigated the homologous genes of the mir-181 family by a sequence similarity search. Representative sequences of the mir-181 gene family were used to reconstruct their evolutionary history. Our results indicated that this family could have derived from multiple duplications, which include two rounds of whole genome duplications and one round of segmental replication. Functional annotation of the target genes of the mir-181 family suggested that this family could participate in some important biological processes including transcriptional and translational regulation, signaling transduction etc. This analysis presented a complex evolutionary dynamics for the origination of a miRNA gene family. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {microRNAs (miRNAs) are a large class of small non-coding RNAs which post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of a large fraction of all animal genes and are important in a wide range of biological processes. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing allow miRNA detection at unprecedented sensitivity, but the computational task of accurately identifying the miRNAs in the background of sequenced RNAs remains challenging. For this purpose, we have designed miRDeep2, a substantially improved algorithm which identifies canonical and non-canonical miRNAs such as those derived from transposable elements and informs on high-confidence candidates that are detected in multiple independent samples. Analyzing data from seven animal species representing the major animal clades, miRDeep2 identified miRNAs with an accuracy of 98.6-99.9{\%} and reported hundreds of novel miRNAs. To test the accuracy of miRDeep2, we knocked down the miRNA biogenesis pathway in a human cell line and sequenced small RNAs before and after. The vast majority of the {\textgreater}100 novel miRNAs expressed in this cell line were indeed specifically downregulated, validating most miRDeep2 predictions. Last, a new miRNA expression profiling routine, low time and memory usage and user-friendly interactive graphic output can make miRDeep2 useful to a wide range of researchers.},
